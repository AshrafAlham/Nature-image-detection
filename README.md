# Agentic-RAG-Application-DeepSeek

## Overview
the goal of my project is to classify any image to these categories this will help us to good recognition to the nature and use these models for any future tasks and you can use it on mutable classes like detection of place for someone and you can detect how he can live from the nature of his life, also I have another objective is to compare the results of multiple models like ( VGG16 – VGG19 – My customized model – Inception – ResNet) and get the best accuracy for each one and also use ensemble technique to get the best model prediction for each image to reduce the loss and error can happens.



## Features
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves relevant information from large datasets.
- **Enhanced Generation**: Generates coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Incorporates agent behaviors to improve interaction and decision-making.


## Usage
To use the image detection, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/youssefhosni/agentic-rag.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd agentic-rag
    ```
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
